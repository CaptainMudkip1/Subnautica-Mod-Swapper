## Subnautica Mod Swapper

This simple tool can swap between two installations of Subnautica.

### Installation

You can download the file from the github page, or you can build it yourself with Visual Studio.  To begin installation, install Subnautica and run the program. It will create a file in the same directory, where you will need to enter in the path to your games folder. For example, the default Steam game folder is ```C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\```.  When you have this done, rerun the program.  You will then have to reinstall Subnautica from Steam.  After you do this the installation is complete.
